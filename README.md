# Alephium Brand Guide
Repository for Alephium's production-ready graphic identity.

## Logoâ€™s variants

In an effort to simplify and consolidate our branding before future evolutions, we're recommanding to use the white logo on a black backgound.
When used as a token logo (ie. on Coinmarketcap, Coingecko etc.), please use the round logo.
