# Alephium Brand Guide
Repository for Alephium's production-ready graphic identity. Alephium is a project that is evolving at high pace. The brand reflects this nature and may therefor be subject to changes.

## Logo's colors

We recommend using the variant of the logo with a dark grey background when used as the token logo. In general, this is the preferred logo as it works well on both light and dark backgrounds.
