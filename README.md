# Alephium Brand Guide
Repository for Alephium's production-ready graphic identity. Alephium is a project that is evolving at high pace. The brand reflects this nature and may therefor be subject to changes.

## Logo's color variants

Our logo exists in dark and light variants. We recommend using the variant with a dark grey background when the logo is used as a token image. In general, this is the preferred variant as it works well on both light and dark backgrounds.
