# Alephium Brand Guide  
Repository for Alephium's production-ready graphic identity.

## Logo Variants  

To simplify and consolidate our branding ahead of future evolutions, we recommend using the **white logo on a black background** as the default.  

When used as a token logo (e.g., on platforms like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko), please use the **round logo**.

## Logo Layout  

Below are the two approved logo layouts for external usage:  
- The **logo alone** is the preferred option.  
- Please **do not use the wordmark alone**.
